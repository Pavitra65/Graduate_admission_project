## Data Science Project: Graduate Admission Prediction using Machine Learning


### Introduction:
Welcome to my GitHub repository, which highlights a major project I worked on while pursuing a data science bachelor's degree. I'll give an outline of the project's goals and methods, as well as the techniques and realizations, in the sections that follow.

### Project Outline:
I spent a semester studying into an important problem in the field of data science as part of the university course "Hands-On Machine Learning and Data Science": expectations for postgraduate admissions chances at US universities.

### Workflow:
- **Data Collection**
- **Data Preprocessing**
- **Model evaluation**
- **Fine Tuning**
- **Summary**
